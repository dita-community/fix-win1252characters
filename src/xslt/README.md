XSLT transform for correcting characters that came from the Windows 1252 code page.

The htmlWin1252CharacterMap.xsl defines the mapping from the 1252 code points to
the appropriate Unicode characters. You can use this file for reference or use it
from an XSLT transform to handle these characters.

Cleanup transform TBD.
